# MeltingSanctuaries

Melting Sanctuaries is my first collaborative web project, built as a creative introduction to web development. While the file organization reflects the learning stage, the project captures an immersive glacial atmosphere through glacier animations, particle effects, and parallax scrolling.

---

## Project Highlights

- Moving glaciers and subtle animations that create a dynamic, icy landscape.  
- Wildlife elements such as polar bears, narwhals, and other endangered species presented in interactive sections.  
- Snow and particle effects (via particles.js) to reinforce the frozen, atmospheric theme.  
- A focus on climate change awareness, showing the shrinking numbers of animals in glacial habitats.

## Features

- Parallax glacier animations responsive to scrolling  
- Interactive animal showcase with educational elements  
- Particle-based snowfall effects for added immersion  
- Scroll-triggered transitions for smooth storytelling

## Notes

- This was my first website project, created with a team.  
- The codebase is unpolished, but it reflects the learning process.  
- Some images are very large; future improvements include compression or moving assets to Git LFS.
