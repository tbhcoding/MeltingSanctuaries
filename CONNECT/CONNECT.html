                        Musk oxen are animals that live in the cold Arctic and wander around in search of roots, mosses, and lichens to eat. They use their hooves to dig through snow and find these plants during winter. In summer, they eat Arctic flowers and grasses, and often feed near water. However, climate change has affected their habitat, enabling parasites and lungworms to expand their range in the musk oxen environment. Winter food sources are also compromised as freezing rain hardens the snowpack, making it more difficult for the musk oxen to dig through snow to graze on these plants.
